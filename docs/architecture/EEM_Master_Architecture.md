## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the high-level architecture strategy for the Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) system. EEM is designed as a resource-efficient, open-source intelligence (OSINT) system integrating geolocation, facial recognition, identity management, and public records access. The architecture prioritizes modularity, scalability, security, privacy, and resource optimization through techniques like lazy loading and event-driven design.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Modularity**: Components will be designed as independent modules with well-defined interfaces.
- **Scalability**: The architecture will support scaling individual components based on load.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lazy loading and an event-driven approach will minimize dormant resource consumption.
- **Security & Privacy**: End-to-end encryption, minimal data retention, secure credential management (Phase 10), and compliance with regulations are paramount.
- **Extensibility**: The design will facilitate the addition of new data sources or analysis modules.
- **Testability**: Components will be designed for automated testing.

## 3. Core Architectural Pattern: Event-Driven Microservices

EEM will be built using an event-driven microservices architecture.

- **Event Bus**: A central message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or a simpler Python-based implementation if sufficient) will handle communication between components. Events will represent significant occurrences (e.g., new data ingested, analysis task requested, result available).
- **Microservices**: Each major capability (Geolocation, Facial Recognition, Identity Management, Public Records, API Key Security, UI Backend) will be implemented as one or more microservices. Services subscribe to relevant events and publish events upon completing tasks or generating results.
- **Orchestration Engine**: A dedicated service will manage complex workflows involving multiple components, subscribing to task requests and publishing sequences of events to trigger the appropriate services.
- **Trigger Evaluation Engine**: This engine monitors incoming data and system events, evaluating predefined rules to trigger specific workflows or actions (implementing the lazy loading concept).

## 4. Key Components & Dependencies

*(High-level overview; detailed design in subsequent sections)*

- **Core Framework**: 
    - Event Bus
    - Orchestration Engine
    - Trigger Evaluation Engine
    - Resource Monitor
    - State Manager
    - API Gateway (for UI and external interactions)
- **Geolocation Pipeline**: 
    - Ingestion Service (Image/Video)
    - Computer Vision Analysis Service
    - Geographic Knowledge Service
    - *Depends on*: Core Framework
- **Facial Recognition System**: 
    - Face Detection Service
    - Face Recognition Service
    - Social Media Integration Service (requires careful API key management)
    - Privacy Control Service
    - *Depends on*: Core Framework, Identity Management
- **Identity Management System**: 
    - User Directory Service
    - Authentication Service
    - Evidence Management Service
    - Credential Verification Service
    - *Depends on*: Core Framework
- **Public Records Integration**: 
    - Connector Services (Vital, Govt, Property - potentially one service per major source type)
    - Correlation Engine
    - *Depends on*: Core Framework, Identity Management, API Key Security
- **API Key Security System (Phase 10)**: 
    - Secure Vault (HSM simulation/abstraction)
    - Lifecycle Manager (Create, Rotate, Destroy)
    - Authentication Service
    - *Depends on*: Core Framework
- **User Interface (UI)**:
    - Frontend Application (Web-based)
    - Backend API Service (interacts with API Gateway)
    - *Depends on*: Core Framework (via API Gateway)
- **Practice Mode**: 
    - Session Isolation Layer
    - Ephemeral Storage Manager
    - Annotation Service
    - Privacy Filter Service
    - *Depends on*: All other analytical components, Core Framework

**Dependency Flow**: Core Framework -> Identity/API Security -> Geolocation/Facial Rec -> Public Records -> UI/Practice Mode.

## 5. Optimization Patterns

- **Lazy Loading**: The Trigger Evaluation Engine will activate services only when specific events or data patterns are detected, keeping inactive components dormant.
- **Resource Monitoring**: A dedicated service will track resource usage (CPU, memory) of components. The Orchestration Engine can use this data to manage load or potentially scale services (if container orchestration like Docker/Kubernetes is used).
- **Asynchronous Processing**: The event-driven nature allows for non-blocking, asynchronous task execution.
- **Data Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., geographic knowledge, known identities) where appropriate and secure.
- **Efficient Data Formats**: Use efficient data serialization formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, MessagePack) for inter-service communication.

## 6. Technology Stack Considerations

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI recommended for API services due to performance and async support).
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch (as specified).
- **Event Bus**: Consider lightweight options like `dramatiq` or `celery` with Redis/RabbitMQ, or a custom implementation if external dependencies are restricted.
- **Databases**: Choose appropriate databases for different needs (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured data, potentially a graph database for correlations, secure storage for identity/keys).
- **Containerization**: Docker (as specified) for packaging and deployment consistency.
- **Frontend**: Standard web technologies (React, Vue, or Angular).

## 7. Core Framework Design




### 7.1. Event-Driven Architecture & Trigger Evaluation



# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Core Framework Design: Event-Driven Architecture & Trigger Evaluation

## 1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

### 1.1. Overview

The core of EEM's inter-component communication relies on an Event-Driven Architecture. This promotes loose coupling, scalability, and resilience. Services communicate asynchronously by producing and consuming events via a central Event Bus.

### 1.2. Event Bus

- **Technology Choice**: While Kafka or RabbitMQ offer robustness, a simpler Python-based solution using libraries like `Dramatiq` or `Celery` with a Redis or RabbitMQ backend might suffice initially, balancing complexity and features. A custom implementation could be considered if external dependencies are highly restricted, but standard libraries are preferred for reliability.
- **Event Structure**: Events will follow a standardized JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "eventId": "uuid", // Unique event identifier
    "eventType": "string", // e.g., "data.image.ingested", "analysis.geolocation.requested", "result.facerec.completed"
    "sourceService": "string", // Name of the service publishing the event
    "timestamp": "iso8601_datetime",
    "correlationId": "uuid", // Optional: To track related events in a workflow
    "payload": { ... } // Event-specific data
  }
  ```
- **Topics/Queues**: Events will be published to specific topics or queues based on their type or domain (e.g., `ingestion`, `analysis.geo`, `analysis.face`, `identity`, `records`, `system.monitor`). Services subscribe to the topics relevant to their function.

### 1.3. Service Interaction

- **Producers**: Services publish events to the bus when significant actions occur (e.g., data ingestion, task completion, state change).
- **Consumers**: Services subscribe to relevant event topics. Upon receiving an event, they perform their designated task (e.g., analysis, data storage, triggering another workflow).
- **Asynchronicity**: Interactions are asynchronous. Producers don't wait for consumers to process events.

## 2. Trigger Evaluation Engine

### 2.1. Purpose

The Trigger Evaluation Engine implements the "lazy loading" concept. It monitors the event bus for specific event patterns or data conditions and triggers appropriate workflows or service activations only when necessary. This minimizes resource usage by keeping components idle until needed.

### 2.2. Design

- **Rule-Based System**: The engine operates based on a configurable set of rules.
- **Rule Structure**: Each rule defines:
    - `triggerEvents`: A list or pattern of event types that can initiate the rule evaluation.
    - `conditions`: Logical conditions based on event payloads or system state (e.g., `event.payload.image_size > 1MB`, `system.state.user_active == true`).
    - `actions`: Events to be published or direct service calls to be made if conditions are met (e.g., publish `analysis.geolocation.requested` event).
- **Implementation**: 
    - A dedicated microservice (`trigger-engine`) subscribes to a broad range of events or specific trigger events.
    - It maintains a registry of active rules (potentially loaded from a configuration file or database).
    - Upon receiving a relevant event, it evaluates applicable rules against the event payload and current system state (obtained via state management service or cached data).
    - If a rule's conditions are met, it executes the defined actions (e.g., publishing a new event to the bus to start a workflow).

### 2.3. Example Workflow (Lazy Loading Geolocation)

1.  **Event**: `data.image.ingested` published by Ingestion Service.
2.  **Trigger Engine**: Receives the event. Finds a rule:
    - `triggerEvents`: [`data.image.ingested`]
    - `conditions`: `event.payload.metadata.has_gps == false && event.payload.metadata.needs_geolocation == true`
    - `actions`: Publish `analysis.geolocation.requested` with relevant image ID.
3.  **Evaluation**: Engine checks the event payload. If conditions match, it proceeds.
4.  **Action**: Engine publishes `analysis.geolocation.requested` event.
5.  **Geolocation Service**: Subscribed to `analysis.geolocation.requested`, receives the event, and activates to perform analysis.

## 3. Integration

- The Event Bus is the central communication backbone.
- The Trigger Evaluation Engine acts as an intelligent listener on the bus, selectively initiating actions based on predefined logic.
- All other services interact primarily through the Event Bus, either producing events or consuming events triggered directly or via the Trigger Engine.

### 7.2. Resource Monitoring Framework

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Core Framework Design: Resource Monitoring Framework

## 1. Purpose

The Resource Monitoring Framework provides visibility into the resource consumption (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O) of individual EEM microservices. This data is crucial for:

- **Optimization**: Identifying performance bottlenecks and resource-hungry components.
- **Adaptive Allocation (Future Scope)**: Enabling dynamic scaling or resource allocation adjustments based on real-time load (potentially integrating with orchestrators like Kubernetes HPA or custom logic).
- **Health Monitoring**: Detecting services exhibiting abnormal resource usage patterns, which might indicate errors or failures.
- **Cost Management (Cloud)**: Tracking resource usage for potential cost allocation and optimization in cloud environments.

## 2. Design

### 2.1. Monitoring Agent

- **Approach**: Each microservice instance (or its container) will have a lightweight monitoring agent associated with it. 
- **Implementation Options**:
    1.  **Sidecar Container (Docker/Kubernetes)**: A dedicated monitoring container runs alongside the service container, collecting metrics via shared process namespaces or Docker stats API.
    2.  **Integrated Library**: The service itself includes a library (e.g., `psutil` in Python) that periodically collects its own resource metrics.
    3.  **Host-Level Agent**: A node-level agent (like `node_exporter` for Prometheus) collects metrics for all processes/containers on the host.
- **Preferred Approach**: For containerized environments (Docker), the sidecar or host-level agent approach is generally preferred as it decouples monitoring logic from the application code. If not containerized, an integrated library is a viable alternative.

### 2.2. Metrics Collection

- **Key Metrics**: 
    - CPU Utilization (%)
    - Memory Usage (RSS, VMS, %)
    - Network I/O (bytes sent/received)
    - Disk I/O (bytes read/written)
    - Process/Thread Count
- **Frequency**: Metrics will be collected at configurable intervals (e.g., every 15-60 seconds).

### 2.3. Metrics Aggregation & Storage

- **Central Aggregator Service**: A dedicated `resource-monitor-aggregator` microservice will receive metrics data from all agents.
- **Data Transmission**: Agents will push metrics to the aggregator via lightweight protocols (e.g., UDP, HTTP POST) or metrics can be pulled by the aggregator (Prometheus model).
- **Storage**: 
    - **Time-Series Database (TSDB)**: Ideal for storing monitoring data (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB). This allows efficient querying and analysis over time.
    - **Alternative**: If a full TSDB is too complex for the initial scope, metrics could be logged or stored temporarily in a simpler database or even published as events on the Event Bus for immediate consumption (though less ideal for historical analysis).

### 2.4. Adaptive Allocation (Conceptual)

- **Mechanism**: While full auto-scaling might be complex initially, the framework lays the groundwork.
- **Process**: 
    1. The `resource-monitor-aggregator` analyzes incoming metrics against predefined thresholds or historical patterns.
    2. If thresholds are breached (e.g., sustained high CPU on Geolocation service), it publishes a `system.resource.alert` event.
    3. The Orchestration Engine or a dedicated scaling manager could subscribe to these alerts.
    4. Based on the alert and scaling policies, the orchestrator could potentially:
        - Request more resources for the service (if using Kubernetes/Docker Swarm).
        - Throttle incoming requests to the overloaded service.
        - Trigger notifications for manual intervention.
- **Initial Scope**: Focus on collecting and exposing metrics. Adaptive allocation can be a future enhancement built upon this data.

## 3. Integration

- **Agents**: Deployed alongside or integrated into each microservice.
- **Aggregator**: Runs as a standalone service, potentially subscribing to service discovery events to know which agents to expect data from or scrape.
- **Data Consumers**: Other services (like an Admin Dashboard UI, Orchestration Engine) can query the Aggregator/TSDB for resource data.

## 4. Technology Considerations

- **Metrics Libraries (Python)**: `psutil`
- **Agents**: Prometheus `node_exporter`, `cAdvisor`, custom agents.
- **Aggregator/Storage**: Prometheus, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.
- **Protocols**: Prometheus exposition format, InfluxDB Line Protocol, standard HTTP.

### 7.3. State Management System

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Core Framework Design: State Management System

## 1. Purpose

The State Management System is responsible for tracking and managing the lifecycle state of various components and long-running processes within the EEM system. This includes:

- **Service State**: Tracking whether individual microservices are running, idle, processing, or in an error state.
- **Task/Workflow State**: Monitoring the progress of complex, multi-step analysis tasks or workflows orchestrated across multiple services (e.g., the status of a full OSINT investigation request).
- **Data State**: Keeping track of the processing state of specific data items (e.g., image `xyz.jpg` is currently undergoing geolocation analysis).
- **Configuration State**: Potentially managing dynamic configuration states for components.

This centralized state view is essential for coordination, monitoring, error recovery, and providing status updates to the user interface.

## 2. Design

### 2.1. State Representation

- **State Model**: Define standardized state models for different entities (services, tasks, data items). Examples:
    - **Service State**: `[Initializing, Idle, Active, Processing, Error, ShuttingDown]`
    - **Task State**: `[Pending, Running, Paused, Completed, Failed, Cancelled]`
    - **Data Processing State**: `[Received, Queued, GeolocationProcessing, FaceRecProcessing, Correlating, AnalysisComplete, Error]`
- **State Storage**: A persistent storage mechanism is required to maintain state across service restarts and failures.
    - **Database**: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a key-value store (e.g., Redis, etcd) could be used. Redis is often suitable for frequently updated, ephemeral state, while PostgreSQL offers more robust querying and persistence.
    - **Choice**: A combination might be optimal: Redis for frequently changing service/task heartbeats and short-lived states, and PostgreSQL for persistent task/workflow history and critical states.

### 2.2. State Management Service (`state-manager`)

- **Centralized Logic**: A dedicated microservice (`state-manager`) will manage state transitions and provide an API for querying state.
- **API**: Offers endpoints for:
    - `POST /state/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`: Update the state of a specific entity.
    - `GET /state/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`: Retrieve the current state of an entity.
    - `GET /state/{entity_type}?query_params`: Query states based on criteria (e.g., all tasks in 'Running' state).
- **Event Integration**: 
    - **Consumes Events**: Subscribes to relevant events from the Event Bus (e.g., `service.started`, `task.initiated`, `analysis.step.completed`, `service.error`) to automatically update states.
    - **Publishes Events**: Can publish state change events (e.g., `task.state.changed`, `service.state.changed`) to notify other interested components (like the UI backend or Orchestration Engine).

### 2.3. State Update Mechanisms

- **Heartbeats**: Services can periodically send heartbeat signals (either via direct API calls to `state-manager` or by publishing `service.heartbeat` events) to indicate they are alive and processing. The `state-manager` can mark services as 'Error' or 'Unknown' if heartbeats are missed.
- **Explicit Updates**: Services explicitly update their state or the state of tasks/data they are processing by calling the `state-manager` API or publishing specific state transition events.
- **Event-Driven Updates**: The `state-manager` infers state changes by listening to the flow of events on the bus (e.g., seeing `analysis.geolocation.started` implies the associated task is now 'Running').

### 2.4. Component Lifecycle Management

- **Startup**: When a service starts, it registers itself with the `state-manager` (or the manager detects it via service discovery/events) and sets its initial state (e.g., `Initializing` -> `Idle`).
- **Processing**: When undertaking work (e.g., consuming a task event), a service updates its state to `Processing` and potentially updates the state of the task it's working on.
- **Shutdown**: Services should ideally notify the `state-manager` upon graceful shutdown.
- **Failure**: Missed heartbeats or specific error events allow the `state-manager` to mark components or tasks as being in an `Error` state.

## 3. Integration

- **Services**: All major microservices interact with the `state-manager` (directly or indirectly via events) to report their status and the status of work they perform.
- **Orchestration Engine**: Relies heavily on the `state-manager` to understand the current status of workflows and decide on the next steps.
- **Trigger Evaluation Engine**: May use state information as part of its rule conditions (e.g., only trigger facial recognition if the `identity-management` service state is `Active`).
- **UI Backend**: Queries the `state-manager` to display status information to users.

## 4. Technology Considerations

- **Databases**: Redis, PostgreSQL, etcd.
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (Python).
- **Concurrency**: Needs to handle concurrent state updates potentially using optimistic locking or database transaction mechanisms.

## 8. Subsystem Designs




### 8.1. Geolocation Pipeline

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Subsystem Design: Geolocation Pipeline

## 1. Purpose

The Geolocation Pipeline is responsible for analyzing visual media (images, video frames) and other potential signals (e.g., text descriptions, metadata) to determine the geographic location depicted or referenced. It aims for high accuracy (<500m specified) by employing computer vision techniques, integrating geographic knowledge, and potentially fusing multiple signals.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The pipeline operates as a set of microservices coordinated via the EEM Event Bus and Orchestration Engine.

**Workflow Trigger**: Typically triggered by an `analysis.geolocation.requested` event published by the Trigger Evaluation Engine or Orchestration Engine, containing references to the input data (e.g., image ID, video ID).

**Key Services**:

1.  **Ingestion/Preprocessing Service (`geo-ingest`)**: Retrieves the source media, extracts relevant frames (for video), normalizes formats, and extracts any available metadata (EXIF GPS, etc.).
2.  **Computer Vision Analysis Service (`geo-cv-analyzer`)**: Performs visual analysis to identify landmarks, environmental features, text (OCR), objects, etc., relevant to geolocation.
3.  **Geographic Knowledge Service (`geo-knowledge`)**: Maintains and provides access to geographic databases (maps, place names, landmark databases, climate data, architectural styles, etc.) to correlate visual cues.
4.  **Signal Fusion & Estimation Service (`geo-estimator`)**: Combines evidence from visual analysis, metadata, and geographic knowledge to produce a final location estimate with a confidence score and accuracy radius.

## 3. Service Details

### 3.1. Ingestion/Preprocessing Service (`geo-ingest`)

- **Input**: Event payload with data reference (e.g., path to image/video file).
- **Tasks**: 
    - Retrieve media file.
    - Extract relevant frames from video (e.g., using scene change detection or fixed intervals).
    - Read EXIF data (especially GPS tags).
    - Image normalization (resizing, color correction if needed).
    - Basic metadata extraction (timestamp, source).
- **Output**: Publishes an event like `geolocation.data.preprocessed` containing references to processed frames/image and extracted metadata.

### 3.2. Computer Vision Analysis Service (`geo-cv-analyzer`)

- **Input**: Subscribes to `geolocation.data.preprocessed` events.
- **Tasks**: Employs various CV models:
    - **Landmark Recognition**: Identify known natural or man-made landmarks (e.g., using pre-trained models like Google Landmark Recognition or custom-trained ones).
    - **Object Detection**: Identify objects that provide regional clues (e.g., specific types of vehicles, vegetation, signage styles).
    - **Scene Classification**: Classify the environment (e.g., urban, rural, coastal, desert, specific biome).
    - **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract text from signs, license plates, posters.
    - **Architectural Style Recognition**: Identify characteristic building styles.
- **Technology**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch with relevant pre-trained or fine-tuned models.
- **Output**: Publishes `geolocation.visual_cues.extracted` event containing a structured list of identified cues (landmarks, text, objects, scene type) with confidence scores and potentially bounding boxes.

### 3.3. Geographic Knowledge Service (`geo-knowledge`)

- **Input**: Provides an API (e.g., REST or gRPC) for querying geographic information. May also subscribe to events if proactive caching or indexing is needed.
- **Tasks**: 
    - **Geocoding/Reverse Geocoding**: Convert place names/text cues to coordinates and vice-versa.
    - **Landmark Lookup**: Find potential locations for recognized landmarks.
    - **Spatial Querying**: Find features within a given area (e.g., "find all cities with coastal access and mountains nearby").
    - **Database Integration**: Interfaces with external APIs (OpenStreetMap, GeoNames, Google Maps Platform - requires API key management) or local databases (e.g., PostGIS enabled PostgreSQL).
- **Output**: Responds to API queries with geographic data (coordinates, place information, feature lists).

### 3.4. Signal Fusion & Estimation Service (`geo-estimator`)

- **Input**: Subscribes to `geolocation.visual_cues.extracted` and potentially other relevant events (e.g., text analysis results if applicable). It also queries the `geo-knowledge` service.
- **Tasks**: 
    - **Cue Correlation**: Queries `geo-knowledge` service with cues from `geo-cv-analyzer` (e.g., "Where is Landmark X located?", "Find locations matching OCR text '...'", "List regions with Scene Type Y").
    - **Hypothesis Generation**: Generates potential location hypotheses based on correlated cues.
    - **Multi-Signal Fusion**: Combines evidence from different cues (visual, metadata GPS, text). This could involve probabilistic methods (Bayesian inference), weighted scoring, or machine learning models trained to estimate location from fused features.
    - **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates a confidence score and estimated accuracy radius for the final location prediction.
- **Output**: Publishes `result.geolocation.completed` event containing the estimated location (latitude, longitude), accuracy radius (e.g., in meters), confidence score, and supporting evidence/cues.

## 4. Data Flow Example

1. `analysis.geolocation.requested` (Image ID: 123)
2. `geo-ingest` consumes, preprocesses -> `geolocation.data.preprocessed` (Image ID: 123, EXIF: None)
3. `geo-cv-analyzer` consumes -> `geolocation.visual_cues.extracted` (Image ID: 123, Cues: [Landmark: Eiffel Tower (0.95), Text: "Rue...", Scene: Urban (0.8)])
4. `geo-estimator` consumes, queries `geo-knowledge` ("Eiffel Tower location?", "Geocode 'Rue...' near Paris?"), fuses results -> `result.geolocation.completed` (Image ID: 123, Lat: 48.8584, Lon: 2.2945, Accuracy: 100m, Confidence: 0.92)

## 5. Considerations

- **Accuracy vs. Speed**: Trade-offs exist between the depth of CV analysis and processing time.
- **Knowledge Base Quality**: The accuracy heavily depends on the comprehensiveness and correctness of the geographic knowledge base.
- **API Costs/Limits**: Reliance on external APIs needs careful management (cost, rate limits, API keys via Phase 10 system).
- **Scalability**: CV analysis can be computationally intensive; `geo-cv-analyzer` may need horizontal scaling.

### 8.2. Facial Recognition System

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Subsystem Design: Facial Recognition System

## 1. Purpose

The Facial Recognition (FaceRec) System identifies and/or verifies individuals by analyzing faces detected in visual media (images, video frames). It integrates with the Identity Management system and incorporates strong privacy safeguards as specified (>95% accuracy at 0.1% FAR). The system may optionally leverage social media or other public sources for matching, subject to strict ethical guidelines and privacy controls.

## 2. Architecture Overview

Similar to the Geolocation pipeline, the FaceRec system is composed of microservices communicating via the EEM Event Bus.

**Workflow Trigger**: Triggered by events like `analysis.facerec.requested` (containing media references and potentially known identity hints) or initiated by the Trigger Evaluation Engine based on detected faces in ingested media.

**Key Services**:

1.  **Face Detection Service (`facerec-detector`)**: Locates human faces within images or video frames.
2.  **Face Preprocessing & Feature Extraction Service (`facerec-extractor`)**: Normalizes detected faces (alignment, lighting correction) and extracts unique biometric feature vectors (embeddings).
3.  **Face Matching/Recognition Service (`facerec-matcher`)**: Compares extracted feature vectors against a database of known identities (managed by Identity Management) or potentially against features extracted from external sources.
4.  **Social Media Integration Service (`facerec-social`) (Optional & Controlled)**: If enabled and ethically permissible, searches public social media profiles for potential matches based on detected faces or associated information. Requires robust API key management (Phase 10) and strict adherence to platform ToS.
5.  **Privacy Control Service (`facerec-privacy`)**: Enforces privacy rules, manages consent (if applicable), anonymizes data for Practice Mode, and audits access.

## 3. Service Details

### 3.1. Face Detection Service (`facerec-detector`)

- **Input**: Event with media reference (e.g., `data.image.ingested`, `analysis.facerec.requested`).
- **Tasks**: 
    - Retrieve media.
    - Employ face detection algorithms (e.g., MTCNN, RetinaFace, or models within OpenCV/Dlib) to identify bounding boxes for all faces.
    - Filter detections based on quality (size, pose, occlusion, blur).
- **Technology**: OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow/PyTorch with pre-trained detection models.
- **Output**: Publishes `facerec.faces.detected` event with media reference and a list of detected face bounding boxes and quality scores.

### 3.2. Face Preprocessing & Feature Extraction Service (`facerec-extractor`)

- **Input**: Subscribes to `facerec.faces.detected`.
- **Tasks**: 
    - Crop faces based on bounding boxes.
    - Perform preprocessing: face alignment (based on facial landmarks), illumination normalization, resizing.
    - Use a deep learning Face Recognition model (e.g., FaceNet, ArcFace, VGGFace) to generate a high-dimensional feature vector (embedding) for each preprocessed face.
- **Technology**: OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow/PyTorch with pre-trained embedding models.
- **Output**: Publishes `facerec.features.extracted` event with media reference, original bounding box info, and the extracted feature vector(s).

### 3.3. Face Matching/Recognition Service (`facerec-matcher`)

- **Input**: Subscribes to `facerec.features.extracted`. Receives feature vector(s).
- **Tasks**: 
    - **1:N Identification**: Compares the extracted feature vector(s) against a database of feature vectors associated with known identities (stored/managed via Identity Management System). Uses efficient search algorithms (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) for large databases.
    - **1:1 Verification**: If a claimed identity is provided in the request, compares the extracted feature vector against the specific stored vector for that identity.
    - Calculates similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) between vectors.
    - Applies a threshold based on the desired False Accept Rate (FAR = 0.1%) to determine matches.
- **Technology**: Vector similarity search libraries (FAISS, Scann), potentially database integration for identity lookup.
- **Output**: Publishes `result.facerec.completed` event containing:
    - Original media/face reference.
    - For Identification: List of potential matching identities (with similarity scores) above the threshold.
    - For Verification: Boolean result (match/no match) and similarity score.
    - Confidence assessment.

### 3.4. Social Media Integration Service (`facerec-social`) (Optional)

- **Input**: Triggered by specific request events (e.g., `analysis.facerec.social_lookup.requested`) potentially containing extracted features or identity hints.
- **Tasks**: 
    - Interfaces with public APIs of social media platforms (if permitted by ToS and ethically sound).
    - May involve searching by name/known associates or potentially submitting images/features if APIs allow (highly sensitive).
    - Requires careful handling of API keys (Phase 10), rate limiting, and data parsing.
- **Output**: Publishes `result.facerec.social_lookup.completed` with potential leads or profile information found.
- **NOTE**: Implementation requires extreme caution regarding privacy, ethics, and legal/ToS compliance.

### 3.5. Privacy Control Service (`facerec-privacy`)

- **Input**: Intercepts or subscribes to various FaceRec events. Provides API for privacy configuration.
- **Tasks**: 
    - **Policy Enforcement**: Checks if FaceRec operations are permitted based on context (e.g., investigation type, user permissions, data source sensitivity).
    - **Consent Management**: If applicable, checks for user consent before processing or storing biometric data.
    - **Anonymization**: For Practice Mode, replaces real feature vectors/identities with synthetic or anonymized ones.
    - **Auditing**: Logs all FaceRec access and processing requests.
    - **Data Retention**: Enforces policies for deleting feature vectors and intermediate data.
- **Output**: Can block operations by not forwarding events or returning errors. Publishes audit log events.

## 4. Data Flow Example (Identification)

1. `analysis.facerec.requested` (Image ID: 456)
2. `facerec-detector` consumes -> `facerec.faces.detected` (Image ID: 456, Boxes: [...])
3. `facerec-extractor` consumes -> `facerec.features.extracted` (Image ID: 456, Features: [Vec1, Vec2])
4. `facerec-privacy` intercepts/validates request (e.g., checks permissions).
5. `facerec-matcher` consumes Feature Vec1, queries Identity DB -> `result.facerec.completed` (Image ID: 456, FaceBox1, Matches: [ID: 789 (Score: 0.96)], Confidence: High)
6. `facerec-matcher` consumes Feature Vec2, queries Identity DB -> `result.facerec.completed` (Image ID: 456, FaceBox2, Matches: [], Confidence: N/A)

## 5. Considerations

- **Accuracy & Bias**: FaceRec models can exhibit bias (demographic disparities). Model selection and testing are critical. Achieving >95% accuracy at 0.1% FAR requires high-quality models and data.
- **Privacy**: Biometric data is highly sensitive. Strong security, encryption (at rest and in transit), access control, and auditing are non-negotiable. Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, BIPA etc., is essential.
- **Database Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of potentially millions of feature vectors require specialized databases/indexes.
- **Ethics**: Clear guidelines on usage, especially regarding social media integration and potential for misuse, must be established and enforced.

### 8.3. Identity Management System

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Subsystem Design: Identity Management System

## 1. Purpose

The Identity Management (IDM) System serves as the central authority for managing user accounts, authentication, authorization, and the representation of entities (e.g., persons of interest) within the EEM system. It provides secure credential handling, manages evidence associated with identities, and supports verification processes, integrating closely with other subsystems like Facial Recognition and Public Records.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The IDM system is implemented as a set of microservices focused on different aspects of identity and access management.

**Key Services**:

1.  **User Directory Service (`idm-directory`)**: Manages user accounts (for EEM operators), groups, and roles.
2.  **Authentication Service (`idm-authn`)**: Handles user login, session management, and potentially multi-factor authentication (MFA).
3.  **Authorization Service (`idm-authz`)**: Enforces access control policies, determining what actions users or services are permitted to perform based on roles and permissions.
4.  **Entity Management Service (`idm-entity`)**: Manages profiles for entities (persons, organizations) identified or tracked within EEM, linking associated data and evidence.
5.  **Evidence Management Service (`idm-evidence`)**: Stores and manages links to evidence or data points associated with entities (e.g., images containing a face match, public records hits, geolocation results).
6.  **Credential Verification Service (`idm-verifier`)**: Supports processes for verifying credentials or identity claims, potentially integrating with external verification sources or internal consistency checks.

## 3. Service Details

### 3.1. User Directory Service (`idm-directory`)

- **Input**: API for CRUD operations on users, groups, roles.

- **Technology**: Database (potentially graph database like Neo4j for relationship modeling, or relational like PostgreSQL).
- **Output**: Provides entity profiles and relationships via API. Publishes events like `entity.created`, `entity.updated`.

### 3.5. Evidence Management Service (`idm-evidence`)

- **Input**: API for associating evidence with entities. Events from analysis services (Geo, FaceRec, Public Records) containing results.
- **Tasks**: 
    - Store metadata about evidence items (e.g., source URL/path, type, timestamp, confidence score).
    - Link evidence items to one or more entity profiles in `idm-entity`.
    - Provide query capabilities to retrieve all evidence linked to an entity.
- **Technology**: Database optimized for storing metadata and relationships (PostgreSQL, potentially document DB like MongoDB).
- **Output**: Provides evidence linkage information via API.

### 3.6. Credential Verification Service (`idm-verifier`)

- **Input**: API for initiating verification requests for specific entity claims or credentials.
- **Tasks**: 
    - Orchestrate verification workflows.
    - May involve cross-referencing data within EEM (e.g., checking consistency across public records linked via `idm-evidence`).

### 8.4. Public Records Integration Framework

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Subsystem Design: Public Records Integration Framework

## 1. Purpose

The Public Records Integration Framework is responsible for accessing, retrieving, parsing, and correlating data from various publicly accessible record sources. This includes vital records (birth, death, marriage), government records (voter registration, tax assessment, professional licenses, court records), and property records (ownership, permits, utilities where public). The goal is to enrich entity profiles managed by the Identity Management system and provide valuable context for OSINT investigations, while strictly adhering to legal and ethical constraints.

## 2. Architecture Overview

This framework consists of specialized connector services for different record types and a central correlation engine.

**Workflow Trigger**: Triggered by events like `analysis.public_records.requested` (containing entity identifiers or search parameters) or potentially by the Trigger Evaluation Engine based on entity updates.

**Key Services**:

1.  **Connector Services (`records-connector-<type>`)**: Separate microservices or modules designed to interact with specific types of public record sources (e.g., `records-connector-vital`, `records-connector-property`). These handle the specific protocols, data formats, and access procedures for each source (API calls, web scraping, document parsing).
2.  **Data Parsing & Standardization Service (`records-parser`)**: Takes raw data retrieved by connectors and parses it into a standardized EEM record format.
3.  **Correlation Engine (`records-correlator`)**: Analyzes standardized records, links them to existing entities in the IDM system, and identifies potential relationships or discrepancies.
4.  **Legal & Compliance Module (`records-compliance`)**: A cross-cutting concern, likely implemented as a library or middleware used by connectors, ensuring all access adheres to jurisdictional laws, terms of service, and EEM policies.

## 3. Service Details

### 3.1. Connector Services (`records-connector-<type>`)

- **Input**: Events or API calls specifying the entity/search parameters and the target record type/jurisdiction.
- **Tasks**: 
    - Determine the appropriate data source(s) based on record type and jurisdiction.
    - Interact with the source: Call official APIs (requires API key management - Phase 10), perform web scraping (requires careful design to handle website changes and respect `robots.txt`/ToS), or access public data files.
    - Handle authentication, rate limiting, and specific query formats for each source.
    - Retrieve raw data (HTML, JSON, XML, PDF, text files).
    - **Crucially**: All interactions must pass through checks defined by the `records-compliance` module.
- **Technology**: Python (using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, PDF parsing libraries), potentially browser automation tools (like Playwright) for complex sites (use sparingly).
- **Output**: Publishes `records.raw_data.retrieved` event containing the raw data and source metadata.

### 3.2. Data Parsing & Standardization Service (`records-parser`)

- **Input**: Subscribes to `records.raw_data.retrieved` events.
- **Tasks**: 
    - Identify the format of the raw data.
    - Parse the data to extract relevant fields (names, dates, addresses, identifiers, etc.).
    - Handle variations in data formats across different sources and jurisdictions.
    - Convert extracted data into a standardized EEM record schema (e.g., a common JSON structure for birth records, property records, etc.).
    - Perform basic data cleaning and validation.
- **Technology**: Python (using data manipulation libraries like `Pandas` if applicable, regex, specific parsers for formats like XML/JSON).
- **Output**: Publishes `records.standardized_data.available` event containing the structured, standardized record data.

### 3.3. Correlation Engine (`records-correlator`)

- **Input**: Subscribes to `records.standardized_data.available` events. Queries `idm-entity` and `idm-evidence` services.
- **Tasks**: 
    - **Entity Matching**: Attempts to match the standardized record to existing entity profiles in the `idm-entity` service based on names, dates of birth, addresses, known identifiers, etc. May involve fuzzy matching techniques.
    - **Evidence Linking**: If a match is found (or a new potential entity is created), links the standardized record as evidence to the entity profile via the `idm-evidence` service.
    - **Temporal Analysis**: Analyze dates associated with records to build timelines for entities.
    - **Relationship Discovery**: Identify potential relationships between entities based on shared records (e.g., shared property ownership, marriage records).
    - **Discrepancy Detection**: Flag inconsistencies between different records associated with the same entity.
- **Technology**: Python, potentially graph database concepts for relationship analysis, fuzzy matching libraries (`fuzzywuzzy`, `recordlinkage`).
- **Output**: Updates `idm-entity` and `idm-evidence` via their APIs. May publish events like `entity.evidence.added`, `entity.discrepancy.detected`, `entity.relationship.suggested`.

### 3.4. Legal & Compliance Module (`records-compliance`)

- **Input**: Integrated into connector services before any external access attempt.
- **Tasks**: 
    - Maintain a database/configuration of rules based on jurisdiction, data type, and source ToS.
    - Check if accessing the requested record type from the specific source in the given jurisdiction is legally permissible according to EEM policy and known regulations.
    - Enforce access controls based on user roles/permissions (via `idm-authz`).
    - Log all access attempts and compliance checks for auditing.
- **Technology**: Implemented as a shared Python library or potentially a dedicated microservice providing a compliance check API.
- **Output**: Returns an Allow/Deny decision to the connector, logs the check.

## 4. Data Categories & Connectors (Examples)

- **Vital Records**: Connectors for state/county APIs or websites (birth, death, marriage/divorce). High sensitivity.
- **Government Records**: Connectors for voter registration databases, property tax assessment sites, professional licensing boards, court record portals (e.g., PACER in US, specific state/county portals).
- **Property Records**: Connectors for county recorder/assessor websites, building permit databases.
- **Utility Records**: Generally *not* publicly accessible due to privacy laws. Connectors would only target sources confirmed to be legally public.

## 5. Considerations

- **Legality & Ethics**: Paramount importance. Access must be strictly limited to genuinely public records and comply with all laws (e.g., DPPA in US for DMV records). Misuse carries severe consequences.
- **Data Accuracy & Timeliness**: Public records can contain errors or be outdated. The system should represent data provenance and timestamping clearly.
- **Source Variability**: Websites and APIs change frequently. Connectors require ongoing maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Scraping can be slow and resource-intensive. Rate limiting and efficient scheduling are needed.
- **API Keys & Costs**: Many official APIs require registration, keys (manage via Phase 10), and may have associated costs.

### 8.5. API Key Security System (Phase 10 - Placeholder)

*(Detailed design specified in Phase 10 documentation. This section serves as a placeholder in the master architecture.)*

- **Purpose**: Securely manage the lifecycle (creation, rotation, storage, destruction) of API keys and other credentials used by EEM components, particularly for accessing external services (Public Records APIs, Social Media APIs, Geolocation APIs).
- **Key Features**: Zero-exposure design, automated rotation, HSM integration (simulated/abstracted), envelope encryption, comprehensive auditing.
- **Integration**: Critical dependency for Public Records, Geolocation, and potentially Facial Recognition (Social Media) subsystems.

---

### 8.6. User Interface (Conceptual)

*(Detailed design in Phase 6. This section provides a conceptual overview.)*

- **Type**: Web-based application.
- **Components**: 
    - **Frontend**: Built with a modern framework (React, Vue, Angular). Interacts with the Backend API.
    - **Backend API**: Likely a FastAPI service acting as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF). It interacts with the central API Gateway to communicate with core EEM services.
- **Key Features**: Input interface for initiating tasks, results dashboard, timeline visualization, map interface (for geolocation), entity profile views, administrative controls, Practice Mode interface.
- **Interaction**: Primarily interacts with `idm-authn` (login), `state-manager` (status), and query endpoints exposed via the API Gateway for results and entity data.

---

### 8.7. Practice Mode (Conceptual)

*(Detailed design in Phase 7. This section provides a conceptual overview.)*

- **Purpose**: Provide a safe, isolated environment for training and testing EEM capabilities without using real sensitive data or impacting production systems.
- **Key Features**: 
    - **Session Isolation**: Practice sessions operate independently from real investigations.
    - **Ephemeral Storage**: Data generated during practice is temporary and securely deleted.
    - **Privacy Filters/Anonymization**: Integrates with `facerec-privacy` and potentially other services to use anonymized or synthetic data (e.g., anonymized faces, filtered public records examples).
    - **Educational Annotations**: UI provides explanations and context about the OSINT processes being simulated.
    - **Clear Demarcation**: UI clearly distinguishes Practice Mode from the operational mode.
- **Integration**: Leverages core analysis components (Geo, FaceRec, etc.) but intercepts data flows to apply privacy controls and use isolated storage/identities.

## 9. Integration Patterns




### 9.1. Cross-Component Communication

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Integration Patterns: Cross-Component Communication

## 1. Primary Pattern: Asynchronous Event Bus

As established in the Core Framework design, the primary communication pattern within EEM is asynchronous messaging via a central Event Bus.

- **Mechanism**: Microservices publish events to the bus when significant state changes occur or tasks are completed. Other services subscribe to the events relevant to their function and react accordingly.
- **Benefits**: Loose coupling, resilience (services can function even if others are temporarily down), scalability (easy to add more consumers or producers), supports event-driven workflows and lazy loading.
- **Technology**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, or a Python library like Dramatiq/Celery backed by Redis/RabbitMQ.
- **Event Structure**: Standardized JSON format (as defined in `eem_core_design_eda_trigger.md`):
  ```json
  {
    "eventId": "uuid",
    "eventType": "string", // e.g., "data.image.ingested", "analysis.geolocation.requested"
    "sourceService": "string",
    "timestamp": "iso8601_datetime",
    "correlationId": "uuid", // Links events within a single workflow
    "payload": { ... } // Event-specific data
  }
  ```
- **Topics**: Events are organized into logical topics (e.g., `ingestion`, `analysis.geo`, `analysis.face`, `identity.user`, `entity.evidence`, `records.standardized`, `system.state`, `system.audit`).
- **Use Cases**: Most inter-service communication, including task initiation, result propagation, state updates, and notifications.

## 2. Secondary Pattern: Synchronous Request/Response (API Calls)

While the event bus handles the main workflow, direct synchronous communication is necessary for specific query-based interactions where an immediate response is required.

- **Mechanism**: A service makes a direct request (e.g., HTTP REST or gRPC call) to another service's API endpoint and waits for a response.
- **Benefits**: Simplicity for direct data retrieval, immediate feedback.
- **Drawbacks**: Tighter coupling (caller depends on the availability of the callee), can block the caller, potential for cascading failures.
- **Technology**: 
    - **RESTful APIs (HTTP/JSON)**: Widely understood, easy to implement and consume. Preferred for most synchronous interactions, especially those involving the UI or external systems.
    - **gRPC (HTTP/2 + Protocol Buffers)**: More performant, uses strongly-typed contracts (protobufs), suitable for high-throughput internal service-to-service communication where performance is critical.
- **API Gateway**: A central API Gateway should be used to expose necessary internal APIs (especially IDM, State Management, and potentially query endpoints for results) to the UI backend and potentially external clients. This provides a single entry point, handles authentication/authorization, rate limiting, and request routing.
- **Use Cases**:
    - UI backend querying `state-manager` for task status.
    - `geo-estimator` querying `geo-knowledge` for landmark locations.
    - `facerec-matcher` querying `idm-entity` for known feature vectors.
    - Any service querying `idm-authz` for authorization decisions.
    - Services querying `idm-directory` for user/role information.
    - Admin tools querying `resource-monitor-aggregator` for metrics.

## 3. Communication Standards

### 3.1. Event Naming Convention

- Use a consistent, hierarchical naming scheme: `<domain>.<entity>.<action>`
- Examples: `data.image.ingested`, `analysis.geolocation.started`, `result.facerec.completed`, `entity.evidence.added`, `system.service.started`.

### 3.2. API Design (RESTful)

- **Standard HTTP Verbs**: Use `GET` (retrieve), `POST` (create), `PUT` (update/replace), `PATCH` (partial update), `DELETE` (remove).
- **Resource-Oriented URLs**: e.g., `/entities`, `/entities/{entity_id}`, `/entities/{entity_id}/evidence`.
- **JSON Payloads**: Use JSON for request and response bodies.
- **Status Codes**: Use standard HTTP status codes correctly (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
- **Versioning**: Include API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
- **Authentication/Authorization**: All API endpoints (especially via the Gateway) must be protected, typically using JWTs validated by `idm-authn` and authorization checks via `idm-authz`.

### 3.3. Error Handling

- **Asynchronous (Events)**: 
    - Consumers should handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., malformed payloads, processing failures).
    - Implement dead-letter queues (DLQs) on the event bus to capture events that fail processing repeatedly.
    - Publish specific error events (e.g., `analysis.geolocation.failed`) with details in the payload.
    - The `state-manager` should track task/service failures based on error events or missed heartbeats.
- **Synchronous (APIs)**: 
    - Use appropriate HTTP error codes (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors).
    - Include informative error messages in the response body (JSON format preferred), avoiding sensitive internal details.
    - Implement timeouts and retry mechanisms (with backoff) in clients calling synchronous APIs to handle temporary unavailability.
    - Consider circuit breaker patterns to prevent repeated calls to failing services.

## 4. Service Discovery

In a dynamic microservices environment, services need a way to find the network locations (IP address, port) of other services they need to call directly (synchronously).

- **Mechanisms**: 
    - **Container Orchestrator DNS**: Kubernetes and Docker Swarm provide built-in DNS resolution based on service names.
    - **Service Registry**: Tools like Consul or etcd can be used for services to register themselves and discover others.
- **Choice**: If using Docker/Kubernetes, leverage the built-in service discovery. Otherwise, a lightweight registry or configuration-based approach might be needed.

### 9.2. Data Flow Optimization

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Integration Patterns: Data Flow Optimization

## 1. Purpose

Data flow optimization aims to ensure that data moves efficiently and effectively through the EEM system, minimizing latency, resource consumption (bandwidth, storage, CPU), and processing bottlenecks. This is particularly important for handling potentially large media files and high volumes of events or records.

## 2. Key Optimization Strategies

### 2.1. Efficient Data Serialization

- **Problem**: Transmitting large or complex data structures (e.g., detailed analysis results, feature vectors) between services using inefficient formats (like verbose JSON or XML) consumes excess bandwidth and CPU for serialization/deserialization.
- **Solution**: 
    - Use efficient binary serialization formats like **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** or **MessagePack** for internal service-to-service communication, especially over the event bus or via gRPC.
    - JSON is acceptable for APIs exposed externally (e.g., to the UI) for ease of consumption, but internal flows should prioritize efficiency.
- **Implementation**: Define protobuf schemas for event payloads and gRPC messages. Use corresponding libraries in Python services.

### 2.2. Data Locality & Caching

- **Problem**: Repeatedly fetching the same data (e.g., entity profiles, geographic data, configuration) from source services or databases increases latency and load.
- **Solution**: Implement caching at various levels:
    - **Service-Level Caching**: Individual services can cache frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., using Python dictionaries or libraries like `cachetools`) or via dedicated caching services (Redis, Memcached).
    - **Geographic Knowledge Cache**: The `geo-knowledge` service should cache results from external APIs or database queries.
    - **Identity/Entity Cache**: The `idm-entity` service or its clients might cache recently accessed entity profiles.
    - **Configuration Cache**: Services can cache configuration retrieved from a central source.
- **Implementation**: Use Redis for distributed caching. Implement cache invalidation strategies (e.g., time-to-live (TTL), event-based invalidation) to ensure data freshness.

### 2.3. Selective Data Transmission (Payload Optimization)

- **Problem**: Events or API responses might contain large amounts of data, only a fraction of which is needed by the consumer.
- **Solution**: 
    - **Reference vs. Full Data**: Instead of embedding large data blobs (like images or full public records) directly in events, pass references (e.g., file paths, database IDs, URLs). Consumers fetch the full data only if needed, potentially from a shared storage layer (see below).
    - **Targeted Payloads**: Design event payloads and API responses to include only the data relevant to the specific event type or query. Avoid overly generic, large payloads.
    - **GraphQL (Optional for UI)**: Consider GraphQL for the UI backend API to allow the frontend to request exactly the data fields it needs, reducing over-fetching.
- **Implementation**: Store large binary data (images, videos) in a dedicated object storage solution (e.g., MinIO, Ceph, cloud storage like S3/GCS). Events carry references (e.g., `s3://bucket/image.jpg`).

### 2.4. Asynchronous Processing & Batching

- **Problem**: Processing large volumes of data or events individually can be inefficient due to overhead per item.
- **Solution**: 
    - **Event Bus**: The inherent asynchronicity allows producers to publish events without waiting, and consumers can process them at their own pace.
    - **Batch Processing**: Where applicable, consumers can process events or data in batches rather than one by one. For example, the `records-parser` could potentially parse multiple raw records retrieved in a short time window together. The `facerec-extractor` might batch faces for GPU processing.
    - **Task Queues**: Use task queues (like Celery/Dramatiq) effectively to manage background processing and distribute load.
- **Implementation**: Configure event bus consumers and task queue workers to handle batches where appropriate. Be mindful of batch size to avoid excessive memory usage or processing delays.

### 2.5. Compression

- **Problem**: Transmitting uncompressed data over the network consumes bandwidth.
- **Solution**: Apply compression (e.g., Gzip, Brotli, Snappy) to data payloads, especially for larger event messages or API responses, where the CPU cost of compression/decompression is outweighed by bandwidth savings.
- **Implementation**: Configure web servers (for REST APIs), gRPC libraries, and potentially event bus client libraries to use compression.

### 2.6. Shared Data Storage

- **Problem**: Passing large data files (images, videos) between multiple processing stages via the event bus or direct copies is inefficient.
- **Solution**: Utilize a shared, high-performance storage layer accessible by relevant services.
    - **Object Storage**: Preferred for large binary files (e.g., MinIO, Ceph, S3/GCS). Services access data via standard APIs using references passed in events.
    - **Network File System (NFS/GlusterFS)**: Can be used but often has higher latency and potential bottlenecks compared to object storage for this use case.
- **Implementation**: Set up a MinIO instance (or use cloud equivalent). Services need appropriate credentials/permissions to access the storage.

## 3. Data Flow Example (Optimized Image Geolocation)

1.  **Ingestion**: Image uploaded, stored in Object Storage (e.g., `/eem-data/raw/image123.jpg`).
2.  **Event**: `data.image.ingested` published. Payload contains `{"imageId": "123", "storagePath": "/eem-data/raw/image123.jpg", "metadata": {...}}`. (Small payload, reference to data).
3.  **Trigger Engine**: Evaluates, publishes `analysis.geolocation.requested` with `imageId` and `storagePath`.
4.  **`geo-ingest`**: Consumes event, reads image *from Object Storage*, extracts EXIF, publishes `geolocation.data.preprocessed` (still using references).
5.  **`geo-cv-analyzer`**: Consumes event, reads image *from Object Storage*, performs analysis, publishes `geolocation.visual_cues.extracted` (payload contains extracted cues, not the image).
6.  **`geo-estimator`**: Consumes event, queries `geo-knowledge` (potentially hitting cache), fuses cues, publishes `result.geolocation.completed` (payload contains location result).
7.  **`idm-evidence`**: Consumes result event, stores link between entity and the *original image reference* (`/eem-data/raw/image123.jpg`) along with the geolocation result.

### 9.3. Unified Security Architecture

# Eagle Eye Matrix (EEM) - Integration Patterns: Unified Security Architecture

## 1. Purpose

The Unified Security Architecture defines the principles, components, and practices for securing the entire EEM system. It addresses authentication, authorization, data protection (encryption), credential management, auditing, compliance, and vulnerability management, ensuring a defense-in-depth approach across all components and data flows.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Zero Trust**: Assume no implicit trust between components, regardless of network location. Authenticate and authorize every interaction.
- **Least Privilege**: Grant users and services only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their functions.
- **Defense in Depth**: Employ multiple layers of security controls (network, application, data).
- **Secure by Design**: Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle.
- **Privacy by Design**: Embed privacy controls and considerations from the outset, especially for sensitive data like biometrics and PII.
- **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to relevant legal and regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, jurisdictional laws for public records).

## 3. Key Security Components & Mechanisms

### 3.1. Authentication

- **User Authentication**: Handled by `idm-authn` service using robust methods (hashed passwords, MFA option). Issues JWTs upon successful login.
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: 
    - **Internal APIs (REST/gRPC)**: Require valid JWTs (for user-initiated actions) or potentially service-specific tokens/API keys (for automated interactions) validated by the API Gateway or individual services (via `idm-authn` or a shared library).
    - **Event Bus**: While events themselves don't typically carry authentication, consumers should validate the source service if necessary, and access to the bus itself should be secured.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as the primary authentication enforcement point for external access (UI backend).

### 3.2. Authorization

- **Centralized Policy**: `idm-authz` service evaluates access requests based on user roles/permissions defined in `idm-directory`.
- **Enforcement Points**: 
    - API Gateway (for coarse-grained access to endpoints).
    - Individual microservices (for fine-grained checks on specific resources or actions).
- **Policy Model**: RBAC initially, potentially ABAC for more complex rules.

### 3.3. Data Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit**: 
    - All external HTTP traffic (UI, external APIs) must use TLS/HTTPS.
    - Internal service-to-service communication (REST, gRPC, event bus connections, database connections) should also use TLS where feasible, especially if crossing network boundaries.
- **Encryption at Rest**: 
    - **Sensitive Data**: Passwords (hashed with strong algorithm like Argon2/bcrypt), API keys (managed by Phase 10 system), biometric data (feature vectors), PII in entity/user profiles, and potentially sensitive public records must be encrypted in databases and object storage.
    - **Database Encryption**: Utilize database-native encryption features (e.g., PostgreSQL TDE or column-level encryption).
    - **Object Storage Encryption**: Use server-side encryption features of the object storage system (e.g., MinIO, S3 SSE).
    - **Key Management**: Encryption keys must be managed securely, ideally using a dedicated Key Management Service (KMS) or HSM (as conceptualized in Phase 10).

### 3.4. Credential Management (API Keys, Secrets)

- **Phase 10 System**: The dedicated `EEM_API_Security_System` (Phase 10) is responsible for the secure lifecycle management (generation, rotation, destruction) of API keys used for accessing external services (e.g., social media, public records APIs, map APIs).
- **Internal Secrets**: Configuration secrets (database passwords, internal service keys, JWT signing keys) must be managed securely, *not* hardcoded. 
    - **Methods**: Use environment variables injected securely, secrets management tools (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets), or encrypted configuration files.
- **Zero Exposure**: Follow the principles outlined in Phase 10 to minimize human and application exposure to raw credentials.

### 3.5. Auditing & Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All services must generate detailed audit logs for security-relevant events:
    - Authentication attempts (success/failure).
    - Authorization decisions (allow/deny).
    - Data access and modification (especially for sensitive data like entities, evidence, user profiles).
    - Key management operations (Phase 10).
    - Public records access attempts (via `records-compliance`).
    - System configuration changes.
- **Centralized Log Aggregation**: Logs from all microservices should be collected into a central, tamper-evident logging system (e.g., ELK stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; or Splunk).
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Set up monitoring on aggregated logs to detect suspicious activities or security incidents in real-time.

### 3.6. Network Security

- **Firewalls**: Configure network firewalls to restrict traffic between services and from external networks to only necessary ports and protocols.
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate different parts of the system (e.g., data storage, processing services, UI) into separate network segments if possible.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a reverse proxy, protecting internal services from direct exposure.

### 3.7. Vulnerability Management

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan application dependencies (Python libraries, OS packages) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `pip-audit`, Snyk, trivy).
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security flaws in the source code.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Perform DAST scans against running applications (especially the UI and API Gateway) to find runtime vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct periodic penetration tests (as mentioned in Phase 10) to simulate attacks and identify weaknesses.
- **Patching**: Establish a process for promptly patching vulnerabilities in OS, dependencies, and application code.

### 3.8. Legal & Compliance Integration

- **`records-compliance` Module**: Enforces legal checks before accessing public records.
- **`facerec-privacy` Service**: Enforces privacy rules for facial recognition.
- **Data Retention Policies**: Implement automated data retention/deletion policies based on legal requirements and EEM policies, particularly for PII and biometric data.
- **Consent Management**: If applicable, integrate mechanisms for recording and respecting user consent.
- **Jurisdictional Awareness**: System components dealing with external data (especially Public Records) must be aware of and adapt to varying legal requirements in different jurisdictions.

## 4. Practice Mode Security

- **Isolation**: Ensure strict isolation between the practice mode environment and the production environment (separate databases, key management, potentially network segments).
- **Data Anonymization/Synthesis**: Use the `facerec-privacy` and potentially other dedicated services to ensure only anonymized or synthetic data is used in practice mode.
- **Clear Indicators**: The UI must clearly indicate when the user is operating in practice mode.

## 10. Deployment & Operations (Conceptual)

*(Details to be refined in later phases, particularly Phase 8)*

- **Containerization**: All microservices will be containerized using Docker.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (preferred) or Docker Swarm for managing container deployment, scaling, and networking.
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- **Monitoring**: Resource monitoring (Phase 1 design), application performance monitoring (APM), and log aggregation.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration, potentially using environment variables injected by the orchestrator or a dedicated config service.

## 11. Conclusion

This Master Architecture document outlines the high-level design for the Eagle Eye Matrix system. It establishes a modular, event-driven, and resource-efficient foundation incorporating geolocation, facial recognition, identity management, and public records integration with strong considerations for security, privacy, and compliance. Subsequent phases will involve detailed implementation of these components.
