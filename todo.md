# Eagle Eye Matrix - Phase 1: Advanced Architecture Engineering

- [X] 1. Plan: Create comprehensive architecture strategy with component dependencies and optimization patterns.
- [ ] 2. Core Framework Design:
    - [X] 2a. Design event-driven architecture with trigger evaluation system.
    - [X] 2b. Develop resource monitoring framework with adaptive allocation.
    - [X] 2c. Create state management system for component lifecycle.
- [ ] 3. Subsystem Architecture Design:
    - [X] 3a. Design geolocation pipeline with multi-signal fusion.
    - [X] 3b. Develop facial recognition architecture with privacy controls.
    - [X] 3c. Create identity management system with credential verification.
    - [X] 3d. Design public records integration framework (vital, voting, tax, property).
- [ ] 4. Integration Patterns Design:
    - [X] 4a. Design cross-component communication protocols.
    - [X] 4b. Develop data flow optimization patterns.
    - [X] 4c. Create unified security architecture with legal compliance frameworks.
- [X] 5. Optimize & Document: Refine architecture, document patterns, dependencies, and specifications. Create 'EEM_Master_Architecture' blueprint document.
- [ ] 6. Quality Check: Verify blueprint against PRD requirements (as described in user prompt).
